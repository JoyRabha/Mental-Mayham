# Mental-Mayham
A multi Platform 2D game: Characters trying to recover their mental health

Ideas: <br/>
  ● Characters with different mental illness(such as depression, dual personality, eating disorder)<br/>
  ● The game will have some story components(where the user chooses his actions) and some platform(jump and run) like components.<br/>
  ● Ending: the game ends with character getting over their mental illness in a funny or motivational way.<br/>
  ● The game will have some funny segments where the disorders are portrayed in a funny way without discriminating the dirorder.<br/>
  ● The game should have some positive vibe to help people not get more depressed by playing the game.<br/>
  
## 1 Depression<br/>
